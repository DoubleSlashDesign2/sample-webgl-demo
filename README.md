sample-webgl-demo
=================
This is project that we used to demo Corona running under a WebGL-enabled browser.

See the demo live here: http://blog.coronalabs.com/blog/2014/03/07/coronacards-is-cool-heres-something-even-cooler/

This code also runs perfectly fine as Corona-based native apps on iOS and Android devices!
